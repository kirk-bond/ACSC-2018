1. There is probably a way to automate this task and complete it a lot faster than you can
1. Try seperating the input recieved by spaces
1. Break each word pair into is respective value to solve the problem

## Steps
1. Build a script that connects to the server and gets the first problem
1. Take that input and split it space
1. Convert each word pair into is actual value to build the full number
1. Do the math and send back the answer
