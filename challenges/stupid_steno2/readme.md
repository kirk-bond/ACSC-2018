## Problem

Well that didn't work out the way I thought it would at first.  Lets try to hide it this way

## Flag
acsc18{HiddenInPlainSight}

## Category
Forensics

## Hints
1. The flag isn't encoded or encrytped or anything like that
1. Try some simple color adjustments to the image
1. The "Threshold" function can do some pretty cool stuff

## Steps
1. Open the image in GIMP and play with the threshold control (setting it to 1 will show the image)

## Resources Required
* Just the image file
