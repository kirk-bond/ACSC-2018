# ACSC-2018

Welcome to the 6th annual Army Cyber Skills Challenge.  Thanks for helping out.  This place will be used for the tracking of all planning as well as the development of all challenges.  

**Please take a minute to update the contact.csv file with your contact information.  Under email put whatever email address you want us to get ahold of you at (work or personal)**

## Challenge Development
Anyone is welcome to develop a challenge.  We need challenges for all skill levels from super easy to impossible to solve and everything in between.  Please do challenge development on your own branch.  Don't commit directly to the master branch but instead please put in a pull request.  If you aren't familiar with git and github, you can find some tutorials at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ and at https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial.  Once you make a challenge, please create an issue for the QA/QC of it by click on the issues tab, clicking "New", clicking "Challenge QA/QC".  Label the ticket "<CHALLENGE NAME> QA/QC" and assign labels as instructed in the template.
  
For the README.MD for each challenge (please put each challenge in it's own folder) please include the problem name, a description, the flag, a dummy guide on how to solve it, and some possible hints that can be included in the game engine for a price.  If it needs to be hosted as part of a VM and you are able to create a Docker file for it, go for it.  If not, not a big deal, just label the ticket that it needs to be docerized and we will take a look at it in the future.

## Issues Tracking
The issues tab is for tracking all planning efforts both related and not related to the actual challenge development.  As you work an issue (like scheduling the site) please keep updating the comments so others can see what you are doing.

## Help
If you need any help, please ask.  Either open an issue and label it "Help" or feel free to email me directly.  I appreciate everything you are doing.

## Testing
If you are testing any of the challenges, please make sure you update the related issue for that challenge.  Note that you have tested it, any comments that you would like to add and how you would rate the challenge on a scale from 1-10.  There is a breakdown of the scale at the bottom of each issue ticket.
